# Cat and Dog Image Classifier

This repository contains the Cat and Dog Image Classifier project developed during the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning course.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify images of cats and dogs. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used to train the model with a dataset of labeled cat and dog images.
